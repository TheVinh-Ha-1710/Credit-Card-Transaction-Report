# Credit Card Transaction Report

## Overview

The problem addressed in this project is the need to analyze and extract valuable insights from a large dataset of over 10,000 credit card transaction records. Efficient data transformation, storage, and visualization are essential for detecting patterns and improving decision-making.

This approach is both stable and sustainable, leveraging Python for robust data processing, PostgreSQL for scalable and efficient storage, and Docker for a portable, consistent environment. The use of Docker ensures that the pipeline can be easily deployed and maintained, providing flexibility and reproducibility for future iterations.

The tech stack was chosen for its reliability and scalability. Python (Pandas, NumPy) is well-suited for data manipulation and transformation. PostgreSQL offers a powerful, open-source database solution that ensures structured data management and fast querying, while Docker ensures ease of deployment across different environments. Power BI was selected for its interactive, user-friendly dashboards, enabling clear, actionable insights. This combination provides a strong foundation for sustainable data pipeline development and visualization.

## Datasets Summary

This project utilizes transaction and customer data from 2023:

1. *credit_card.csv* – Transaction records for the entire year.

- Client_Num serves as a foreign key.
- No primary key; a composite key is required.

2. *customer.csv* – Demographic details of customers who made transactions.

- Client_Num is the primary key.

3. *cc_add.csv* and *cust_add.csv* - Additional data for main datasets 

## Workflow Design
